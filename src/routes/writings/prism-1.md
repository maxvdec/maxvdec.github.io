title: 'Prism, my IDE'

excerpt: 'I am making a new IDE, or at least I want to start making it. I do not expect much, but I have always wanted to make one'

An IDE is basically where I spend most of my time when I tackle with computers. It's a weird program, since it's basically a
notepad with steroids. Modern IDEs support a bunch of features 'out-of-the-box', allowing developers to write efficient code.

## My Experience

I have always wanted to find the **_perfect_** IDE, that one that makes you feel amazing, and that makes code (as they say) a **joy to write**.

- I started with Visual Studio, the original. It was... A lot.
- I moved to Mac, and I changed to Visual Studio Code. I started to understand, what the role of an IDE was.
- I then used XCode for a bit, which was incredible (although a bit slow sometimes). Here, I understood the difference between a full IDE and just a regular text editor with extensions and support for React.
- Then I moved to Neovim, which I still love. There I learned the classic Vim Keybindings that accompain me even today
- Then I got JetBrains: I tried Fleet and the rest.
- And finally, I tried Zed, which is very cool

Now, I find myself wandering around code editors, using one and another for different projects, which supposes a lot of work, and knowing
how a lot of programs work. But I mean, it's just a text editor.

## What I want to make

I've always wanted to make an IDE, since I think I could pack it with the design that I want, and I could make it customizable and have a great community.
Zed is an interesting project to look at, and I think the Zed team has done great with the editor they created, since it looks amazing and it feels amazing.

If I make my own IDE I want it to be with great design, so that it feels like a joy to edit code with: simple, but powerful. I want to pack it
with a lot of different things.

## How am I going to make it?

First of all. I must finish this project. I will write through here, every step I achieve and share it with you. Every one or two weeks, I'll post
here what am I working on, as well as how am I doing it.

When I start making a project I have to think first on the Architecture I'll follow. Here's how am I going to make it:

### The Technologies to Use

What technologies to use? Great question. Here's my breakdown:

- I am using Rust for the code editor. Why? I don't know. I am going to regret this further, but still, I think it's good
- I am going to make my own UI framework that suits my needs. It's going to translate to Metal, Vulkan or OpenGL accordingly
- Then, I am just going to make my own tools. Everything from scratch. The way I like it. I am probably going to use Treesitter and more.

I will write further as I implement or do more stuff, that way I am going to be encouradged to keep working.
