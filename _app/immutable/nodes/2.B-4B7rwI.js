I am Max Van den Eynde. I am a developer from Catalonia and I love programming.

I am currently working on a shell called Fusion that borrows elements from Functional Programming.

I love to learn how things work and because I wanted to make games, I discovered programming. I started learning C# and Unity, but quickly focused on the things that I loved most. Computers.

I am passionate about systems and UI. I have tackled a lot of different things: from Ray Tracing and a Game Engine all the way to a Kernel and Operating System, although I roughly can finish any project.

I play an instrument and I like languages. I know how to talk three languages, and I am constantly learning more to expand my horizons (since now I am studying Japanese), and I think that's related to the fact I know about 15 programming languages, from Zig and Swift to Haskell and OCaml, and I enjoy writing code in each of them.
